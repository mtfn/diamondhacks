# Basic: ls recurse
List the contents of the home directory recursively using the `ls` command.
Optimal solution without `cd` is preferred but any solution that works is acceptable.

# Basic: wildcard and redirect
Print the contents of all the files in the current directory using a single command.
Write the `stdout` to a file named `out.txt`.

# Intermediate: 5 biggest data hogs
Run `du` and get the 5 biggest data hogs in the user's home directory using piping,
 `sort` and `head`.

# Intermediate: find and replace
Replace all occurrences of `foo` with `bar` in `file.txt` using `sed`.

# Advanced: word count 
Count the number of words in `file.txt` *without* using `wc`. You can
use any other command you like. Sort in decreasing order.
